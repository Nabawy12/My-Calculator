# My Calculator

A Flutter calculator app inspired by the iPhone Calculator design.

This project is my very first Flutter application where I practiced using `setState` and `StatefulWidget` to manage the app's state and update the UI dynamically. The app implements a simple and elegant calculator with a clean interface, supporting basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and percentage. It also includes clear (AC) and backspace (âŒ«) buttons, decimal support, and sign toggle (+/-), providing a user experience similar to the native iPhone Calculator.

Whether you're learning Flutter or just want a handy calculator app, this project is a great starting point!
